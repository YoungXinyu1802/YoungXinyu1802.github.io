# üí¨ About Me

Hi, my name is Xinyu Yang (Êù®ÂøÉÂ¶§), an incoming Information Science PhD student at Cornell University.

Previously, I got my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from Zhejiang University, China. During my undergraduate, I was fortunate to be a research intern at [Stanford AI Lab](https://ai.stanford.edu/) advised by [Prof. James Zou](https://www.james-zou.com/). I also experienced a wonderful research internship at Zhejiang University DCD Lab advised by [Prof. Fei Wu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/wufei).

My research interest lies in Computational Social Science, Science of Science and AI for social good. At present, my focus lies in conducting large-scale scientific data analyses using cutting-edge computational and machine learning techniques. 
<!-- Through this, he aims to gain a deeper understanding of the principles of science and innovation, with the ultimate goal of making meaningful contributions to society.
I would like to explore how to utilize AI and other computational tools for social good.  -->
Through this, I aim to apply and develop cutting-edge tools to understand the fundamental questions about individuals and collectives, unpack major problems and thereby address substantive questions both in the scientific and social realms.

- We show that there is a ‚Äúmoon shape‚Äù correlation (parabolic uptrend curve) between the test performance on the majority subpopulation and the minority subpopulation.
This nonlinear correlations hold across model architectures, training settings, datasets, and the imbalance between subpopulations.

 **MetaShift: A Dataset of Datasets for Evaluating Contextual Distribution Shifts and Training Conflicts**]

**Contributed Talk** at **ICML 2022** Workshop on [Shift happens: Crowdsourcing metrics and test datasets beyond
ImageNet](https://shift-happens-benchmark.github.io/)

[[PDF]](https://openreview.net/forum?id=iuSDDiqacPj), [[Website]](https://metadataset.readthedocs.io/), [[Video]](https://slideslive.com/38987455/metashift-a-dataset-of-datasets-for-evaluating-contextual-distribution-shifts), [[Code]](https://github.com/YoungXinyu1802/icml-2022/tree/main/shifthappens/tasks/imagenet_metashift)


- MetaShift introduces a collection of >10K sets of images with annotated contexts. It enables evaluating how ML works in different contexts (e.g. indoor cat vs outdoor cat). 
- We provided a distance score that measures the amount of distribution shift between any two of the data sets.
- We presented methods to match labels to ImageNet hierarchy via WordNet ID and construct classification tasks over MetaShift to enable evaluating off-the-shelf ImageNet models.
