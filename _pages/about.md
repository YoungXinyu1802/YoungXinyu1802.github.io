# üí¨ About Me

Hi! My name is Xinyu Yang (Êù®ÂøÉÂ¶§), a first-year Information Science PhD student at Cornell University, advised by [Prof. Yian Yin](https://www.yianyin.net/). I am broadly interested in Data Science, Network Science, Machine Learning and Science of Science. At present, my focus lies in conducting large-scale scientific data analyses using cutting-edge computational and machine learning techniques.

Previously, I got my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from Zhejiang University, China. During my undergraduate, I was fortunate to be a research intern at [Stanford AI Lab](https://ai.stanford.edu/) advised by [Prof. James Zou](https://www.james-zou.com/). I also experienced a wonderful research internship at Zhejiang University DCD Lab advised by [Prof. Fei Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XJLn4MYAAAAJ&hl=en).

<!-- My research interest lies in Computational Social Science, Science of Science, Data Science and AI for social good. At present, my focus lies in conducting large-scale scientific data analyses using cutting-edge computational and machine learning techniques. -->
<!-- Through this, he aims to gain a deeper understanding of the principles of science and innovation, with the ultimate goal of making meaningful contributions to society.
I would like to explore how to utilize AI and other computational tools for social good.  -->
<!-- Through this, I aim to apply and develop cutting-edge tools to understand the fundamental questions about individuals and collectives, unpack major problems and thereby address substantive questions both in the scientific and social realms. -->

- We present a comprehensive large-scale analysis of 7,433 ML dataset documentation on Hugging Face.
- Based on our research findings, we emphasize the importance of comprehensive dataset documentation and offer suggestions to practitioners on how to write documentation that promotes reproducibility, transparency, and accessibility of their datasets, which can help to improve the overall quality and usability of the dataset community.

- We created an automated pipeline using GPT-4 to provide comments on the full PDFs of scientific papers. 
- Our results suggest that LLM and human feedback can complement each other. While human expert review is and should continue to be the foundation of rigorous scientific process, LLM feedback could benefit researchers, especially when timely expert feedback is not available and in earlier stages of manuscript preparation before peer-review.

***ACM MM 2023***

[[PDF]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3581783.3613804)

- We developed a multimodal pipeline for Dunhuang manuscript fragments reconstruction, leveraging text-based localization and a self-supervised contour matching framework, accompanied by a global reconstruction process. Our empirical evaluations reveal that this pipeline exhibits a remarkable success rate in fragment assembly.

- We show that there is a ‚Äúmoon shape‚Äù correlation (parabolic uptrend curve) between the test performance on the majority subpopulation and the minority subpopulation.
This nonlinear correlations hold across model architectures, training settings, datasets, and the imbalance between subpopulations.

 **MetaShift: A Dataset of Datasets for Evaluating Contextual Distribution Shifts**

***Contributed Talk*** at ***ICML 2022*** Workshop on [Shift happens: Crowdsourcing metrics and test datasets beyond
ImageNet](https://shift-happens-benchmark.github.io/)

[[PDF]](https://openreview.net/forum?id=iuSDDiqacPj), [[Website]](https://metadataset.readthedocs.io/), [[Video]](https://slideslive.com/38987455/metashift-a-dataset-of-datasets-for-evaluating-contextual-distribution-shifts), [[Code]](https://github.com/YoungXinyu1802/icml-2022/tree/main/shifthappens/tasks/imagenet_metashift)


- MetaShift introduces a collection of >10K sets of images with annotated contexts. It enables evaluating how ML works in different contexts (e.g. indoor cat vs outdoor cat). 
- We provided a distance score that measures the amount of distribution shift between any two of the data sets.
- We presented methods to match labels to ImageNet hierarchy via WordNet ID and construct classification tasks over MetaShift to enable evaluating off-the-shelf ImageNet models.
