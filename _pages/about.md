# üí¨ About Me

Hi, my name is Xinyu Yang (Êù®ÂøÉÂ¶§), a senior undergraduate student at Zhejiang University majoring in Computer Science. 

I am a research intern at [Stanford AI Lab](https://ai.stanford.edu/) advised by [Prof. James Zou](https://www.james-zou.com/). I am also a research assistant at Zhejiang University DCD Lab advised by [Prof. Fei Wu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/wufei).

My research interest lies in Machine Learning, Computational Social Science and AI for social good.

- MetaShift introduces a collection of >10K sets of images with annotated contexts. It enables evaluating how ML works in different contexts (e.g. indoor cat vs outdoor cat).

**On the Nonlinear Correlation of ML Performance Between Data Subpopulation**

[[PDF]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pddWNODuZ3WuyR6tsjhS1HuJE4nWArBn/view?usp=sharing), [[Website]](https://moonshape.readthedocs.io/), [[Video]](https://slideslive.com/38986287/on-the-nonlinear-correlation-of-ml-performance-berween-data-subpopulations), [[Code]](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/moonshape_subpopulation/)

- We show that there is a ‚Äúmoon shape‚Äù correlation (parabolic uptrend curve) between the test performance on the majority subpopulation and the minority subpopulation.
This nonlinear correlations hold across model architectures, training settings, datasets, and the imbalance between subpopulations.
